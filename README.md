Red-Vs-Blue
===========

Basically TDM for GMod 13 that has Red and Blue spartans. Initial goal is to get a working game (ie: team switcher, crosshairs, guns, etc) and then continue off that and refine it.
The Very Basic TDM files are from a working gamemode that is a basic TDM (obviously) and will be used as a guide as to what is really needed to make a TDM.

===========

Current Issues that need to be resolved are as follows:
//Crosshairs for guns don't work
//Team Switchers don't work (Broken concommand, use functions instead)
//Player Models are not being changed
