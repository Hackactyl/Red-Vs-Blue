//All the folders you see here are blank, and are unnecessary for first release.
//They are simply what needs to be accomplished in time.
//Priority wise, work on scoreboard, hud, classes, teams, and menus first.
//Classes and teams are just there to help keep the files smaller and neater.
//The rest of the folders can be populated any time, though objectives, hitmarkers, and shields would give it a halo feel.
